# DedupImages
Remove duplicate images

This project helps to identify images based on their hash to remove unnecessory files that are taking precious space on our devices.

I had come across lot of mobile backups and forgets even which taken when and overwriting it keeps creating new images with their new name though those are same one and it's 
a very irritated task to go back and check all images to delete manually.

This project is really useful and I am happy that I get lot of them out from my machine.

Sharing to help people like me :)
